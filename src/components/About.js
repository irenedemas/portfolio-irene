      <h2>My life is guided by two simple but powerful principles</h2>
      <h2>ðŸš€ Work Hard</h2>
      <p>I give my all to everything I do â€” otherwise it wouldnâ€™t make sense.
        This also applies to my self-improvement so I am always learning something new.
        Norwegian, Swift, an ancient recipeâ€¦ anything that piques my interest
        and/or helps me become a better, happier version of myself.</p>
      <h2>ðŸ¤— Be Nice to People</h2>
        <p>Communication is a huge part of my life. Besides having studied Advertising,
        PR and Branding, I have always focused on connecting with people
        â€” be it through writing, filmmaking, design, event organization, or anything that I can come up with.</p>
      <h2>... and random things that make me happy</h2>
      <p>Hiking with my dog, writing and reading on trains, learning untranslatable words,
      building things that brighten up someone's day, and avocados.</p>
