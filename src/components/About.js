      <h2>All you never wanted to know about me</h2>
      <p></p>
      <h3>ðŸ’¬ Communication is a huge part of my life</h3>
      <p>Besides having studied Advertising,
      PR and Branding, I have always focused on connecting with people
      â€” be it through writing, filmmaking, design, event organization, or anything that I can come up with.</p>
      <h3>ðŸ¤“ I am always learning something new</h3>
      <p>Norwegian, Swift, an ancient recipeâ€¦ anything that piques my interest
      and/or helps me become a better version of myself.</p>
      <h3>ðŸ¥‘ Random things that make me happy</h3>
      <p>Hiking with my dog, writing and reading on trains, learning untranslatable words,
      building things that brighten up someone's day, and avocados.</p>
