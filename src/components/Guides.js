        <h1>ASK IRENE</h1>
        <h2>Ask Irene is a web app that helps you find the perfect spot for any occasion üçú</h2>
        <p>I've been obsessed with food, cozy caf√©s and cool bathrooms for as long as I can remember. Thanks to that, I have a mental database of places and always end up recommending them to friends,
                acquaintances and nosy strangers. On <a href="https://www.irene.cool" target="_blank">Ask Irene</a> you can access my wisdom 24/7
                to find the perfect spot for you. Meanwhile I'll keep hunting for hidden gems in my hometown Barcelona and anywhere I go.
